"This past week included a bright and stony Sauvignon Blanc from Trois Noix wines in Napa, which is admirable for its slightly more austere approach to the grape which reminds me of the more typical European interpretation of the variety. I'm always excited to receive the wines from Can Sumoi, a natural wine project by Raventos i Blanc, based on the revitalization of an old farm in the Penedes region of Spain and its indigenous grape varieties. These wines are made with minimal sulfur additions, organically farmed grapes, and yet they're wonderfully clean and pure. They also come in cute, squat bottles that are probably a nightmare to put into a rack, but look pretty neat. I've got another Armenian wine to share with you this week, from producer Van Ardi, begun by a public accountant from Los Angeles who decided to return to his homeland and make wine. It's a lovely interpretation of the native Areni Noir grape with a little age on it. I also got the latest release from legendary Montalcino producer Biondi-Santi this week. Their 2020 Rosso di Montalcino is elegant and refined, and while it may not have the profundity of Brunello, it's still delicious and will likely age beautifully. It's also a darn sight cheaper than the pricey and hard-to-find Brunello. Lastly, I've got a couple of rich reds from Peter Mathis at Mathis Wine, who focuses on making wines from Sonoma Valley. For those looking for robust and powerful red wines, you'll enjoy both his Grenache and his unusual blend of Petite Sirah, Grenache and other grapes. Notes on all these below. 2022 Can Sumoi Garnaxta Blanca, SpainPale blonde in color, this wine smells of ripe golden apples and white flowers. In the mouth, slightly melon-like flavors mix with white flowers and golden apples as hints of citrus pith emerge in the finish. Bright and juicy thanks to very good acidity. 12.5% alcohol. Certified organic. Score: between 8.5 and 9. Cost: $?? 2019 Mathis Wines ""Uberblend"" Red Blend, Sonoma Valley, CaliforniaVery dark garnet in color, this wine smells of chocolate-covered strawberries. In the mouth, rich strawberry and black cherry flavors mix with a touch of mulling spice and dried herbs. Lightly grippy tannins grab the edge of the palate, but good acidity keeps things dynamic. Notes of oak linger in the finish.  The wine is a blend of 44% Petite Sirah, 33% Grenache, 13% Carignane and 10% Alicante Bouschet. 14.9% alcohol. Packaged in an unnecessarily heavy bottle weighing 1.54 kg when full. Score: around 8.5. Cost: $30."
"How exclusive is Ultramarine, the single-vineyard sparkling wine made by winemaker Michael Cruse? Well, the wine was first released in 2014, and up until a few months ago, I still hadn't tasted a bottle. I will admit, I wasn't exactly bending over backward to taste it, and I'm sure if I had called up Cruse and asked him to send me a sample, he would have done so. But the fact of the matter remains that even hanging out with fellow wine geeks and wine writers, even attending the various industry events I do where many wines flow freely, until a couple of months ago I still hadn't encountered a bottle in the wild, so to speak. I had seen Ultramarine on wine lists at a few fancy restaurants for several hundred dollars, of course, but I was not moved to throw down the cash for a bottle (a polite way of saying it's out of my price range). But then a couple of months ago Cruse sent me an e-mail asking if I'd be interested in attending a small gathering that would feature the first-ever retrospective of his Ultramarine bottlings from Heintz Vineyard, and well, I got to taste some. The project that would eventually become known as Ultramarine began in 2008 when Cruse and ""a couple of buddies"" decided they wanted to do something on their own that wasn't yet another expensive coastal Pinot Noir. ""We said, 'Why not sparkling wine?' but none of us knew anything about it,"" laughs Cruse. ""The first two vintages were literally made in my backyard. We used a bit of topping wine, and some excess grapes, and we got bubbles into them, but they definitely weren't good."" There was something in the process though, that grabbed Cruse, possibly the technical complexity of it all coupled with the added bonus of microbiological science. Undeterred by the first two years of failure, Cruse got serious about his grape sourcing and approached Charlie Heintz, proprietor of the legendary Heintz Vineyard outside of Occidental on the Sonoma Coast. ""I said 'I want to make sparkling wines and I want to buy some of your fruit to do it,'"" recalls Cruse. ""Charlie asked 'Who are you, and where are you from, and what do you know?'"" ""I told him I knew nothing, and he took a chance,"" says Cruse. ""That's really the start of it, honestly."" Cruse, 43, grew up first in San Francisco, and then later in the town of Petaluma in Sonoma County. He attended UC Berkeley, where he studied Molecular Biology, and first encountered the idea of wine as an outlet for his love of science during a lecture by the late Terry Leighton, the microbiologist winemaker behind Kalin Cellars. Cruse must have filed that notion away in his brain. After spending a couple of years post-graduation working in research laboratories, Cruse began to have a sense that academia was not going to make him happy. But maybe wine would. Cruse landed a job working in the enology lab at Sutter Home, thinking that he'd go back to school and get a masters in Enology and Viticulture at UC Davis (he applied and got in), but enjoyed hanging out in the cellar so much that he never bothered to get the degree. Instead, Cruse got a job in the cellar at Merryvale's Starmont winery and worked his way up to associate winemaker before leaving to open a custom crush facility in Petaluma and begin his backyard experimentations with sparkling wine. Armed with two failed vintages, a lot of reading under his belt, the fruit and (somewhat shocking) faith of storied grower Charlie Heintz, Cruse made a couple hundred cases of single-vineyard Chardonnay and Rose in 2010, settled them into his cellar, and waited. Then he did it again ( in 2011, 2012, and 2013, all before selling a single bottle of wine. When Cruse finally did offer to sell some of his first vintage in 2014, word of mouth had already ensured a waiting list of customers, despite almost no one having ever tasted it. Cruse quickly sold most of the wine to his mailing list with a few bottles reserved for restaurants and some boutique distributors. Almost overnight, Ultramarine became the most sought-after sparkling wine in California, and the first California sparkling wine popular enough to be both difficult to purchase and able to be sold at speculative prices. Ultramarine is now sold almost exclusively direct-to-consumer through Cruse's mailing list and continues to be resold at higher multiples on the secondary market. But that's not the most important distinguishing characteristic of Ultramarine. Until Ultramarine came along, all modern California sparkling wines were made in the mold of the great Champagne houses in France. What does that mean? Simply that the wines are crafted (meticulously made and blended) with a house style as their north star rather than with an eye to a specific site. Like the great Champagne houses, most successful California sparkling wine producers source grapes from multiple growers and multiple vineyards, producing wines that have an admirable consistency of character, even when they aim to be single-vintage expressions. Cruse took an entirely different approach to sparkling wine, modeled after the tiny grower-producers of Champagne, the most cutting-edge of whom take a much more Burgundian approach to sparkling wine. Instead of blending to achieve a house style, these producers are laser-focused on the expression of place and work deliberately (usually by hand, in tiny quantities) to remove anything that might get in the way of this communication. Ultramarine was therefore conceived to be an expression of a single individual vineyard site, in a single vintage, often expressed through a single grape (Pinot Noir, or Chardonnay). And while sparkling winemaking ends up being a lot more technical than for still wines, Cruse has opted to keep it as manual, and low-intervention as possible, fermenting the base wine with ambient yeasts and opting to riddle and disgorge by hand. Cruse's two deliberately chosen interventions (quite common in even the most artisan sparkling wine) involve the liberal use of sulfur to block malolactic fermentation and a standard commercial sparkling wine yeast for the secondary fermentation in the bottle. ""It's a dream of mine one day to have my own tirage yeast strain that we've collected and cultured ourselves,"" says Cruse, ""but I don't know why."" Each barrel is going to be its own thing the whole way through. That's the secret recipe I guess. Cruse once tried culturing his own yeasts for use in pet-nat winemaking with disastrous results. ""I made a huge mess,"" says Cruse. ""There was foam everywhere, even on the ceiling, with Petri dishes overflowing everywhere, and our assistant winemaker came in and I felt like a kid who had been caught watching a TV show that he shouldn't be. Charlie took one look, and then backed slowly out of the room."" Until there is a proprietary Ultramarine tirage yeast, however, Cruse believes the thing that truly distinguishes Ultramarine is the pressing regimen. ""I think I'm the only one in California, but we press everything directly to barrel, never to tank,"" says Cruse. ""Effectively this means that every barrel is its own little press cut, rather than making cuts based on cuvee or taille."" Cruse is referencing the standard, regulated practice in Champagne of keeping track of the juice from every batch of grapes that goes into the press. After loading the whole grape bunches into the press, the grapes are squashed three times to yield a specific amount of juice. The juice derived from these three pressings is known as the cuvee, and is usually collected together in a single tank (even if the wine will eventually be barrel fermented). The same batch of grapes is then pressed again up to three more times yielding another smaller batch of juice known as the taille, which by regulation must be collected in a separate tank and is often used judiciously as a blending component later. Cruse doesn't utilize the typical vertical basket press found in Champagne, instead preferring a modern pneumatic press. ""We press really specifically, in a way that is hard to explain,"" says Cruse, ""But essentially we make the pneumatic press work like those old Coquard presses, mimicking the pressure to yield the same kind and quantity of juice you'd get out of the cuvee."" But instead of one big batch of wine, each pressing (which yields roughly 122 gallons of juice) is split into about two barrels of mostly used (25% new) French oak. ""Each barrel is going to be its own thing the whole way through [fermentation],"" says Cruse, ""That's the secret recipe I guess."" In the spring, Cruse tastes through these individual barrels of still wine and then blends them together to make the base wine that goes into bottle for secondary fermentation. The wines stay on their lees in the bottle for 40 to 48 months before being disgorged and topped up with dosage, which ranges from 2 grams per liter of sugar to about 6 grams per liter depending on the bottling. Beginning with the 2017 vintage, Cruse began adding more vineyards to the Ultramarine portfolio, which now includes single-vineyard bottlings from Hirsch Vineyard, Michael Mara Vineyard, and Keefer Ranch Vineyard. Total production hovers around 1400 cases of wine per year, up from an initial quantity of around 150 cases, with roughly 300-700 cases of the total coming from the Heintz Vineyard. Those minuscule numbers are worth considering in a couple of different ways. Firstly the cost of making sparkling wine typically dwarfs the cost of making still wine, both because of the equipment and steps involved, but also because of the space and time required to manage and store all those individual bottles for years before they are sold. The cash flow, frankly stinks, which is why there generally aren't a lot of artisan small sparkling wine producers going it alone. Rather it is much more common to grow a small sparkling wine program as an addition to a well-established operation or to take some wine over to Rack and Riddle and ask them to make you some sparkling wine That Cruse has survived at all is remarkable. But then to have grown the program from a few hundred cases to close to 1500 represents quite an achievement. Add in the numbers from the Cruse Wine Company, a brand under which Cruse makes several more sparkling wines, and the operation is cranking out 2500 cases of bubbles every year. ""I'm not aware of a sparkling wine producer (without a lot of family money behind them) that has gone from zero to that size ever in California,"" says Cruse in a rare moment of self-praise. In more typical Cruse fashion, that statement was shortly followed by, ""After 13 years, I'm not 100% sure I really know what I'm doing."" But of course, to anyone who has tasted these wines, Cruse very much knows what he is doing. He might be humble and soft-spoken, but get him started on the finer points of any element of the winemaking process, or why there are some vineyards that are good for sparkling wine and others that aren't, and watch him go. The wines speak for themselves. They have that wonderful combination of both precision and richness, along with the racy acidity and salinity that makes you want not just another sip but another couple of glasses. I think I prefer the Blanc de Blanc wines and their purity of Chardonnay expression, but every one of the wines tasted below was satisfying and delicious. Some of them are slightly more successful than others, but what more can you expect from someone finding their way, carefully, deliberately, towards greatness? Note that the prices listed below reflect what retailers are charging for these wines on the secondary market. They are sold primarily to mailing list customers for $80 per bottle. 2017 Ultramarine ""Blanc de Blancs - Heintz Vineyard"" Sparkling Wine, Sonoma Coast, CaliforniaPale greenish gold in the glass with extra fine bubbles, this wine smells of tidepools and toasted brioche.

"This week featured a number of spectacular wines that I'm very excited to share with you. Saying the latest vintage of Champagne Louis Roederer's ""Cristal"" is excellent seems a bit like saying the latest model of Ferrari is fast. I've certainly never had a bad vintage of Cristal. But I can say that the wines vary by vintage, and those variations can mean the wines are more or less accessible in their youth. I found the 2014 vintage quite lean and austere when it was first released, for instance, leading me to believe it was best drunk not now, but in a couple of years. (And, of course, these wines can age beautifully for decades). The 2015 Cristal, on the other hand, is broad and generous, seemingly quite ready to drink now, and offers everything you could want in a prestige vintage Champagne bottling. Impeccable precision, gorgeous aromatics, and mouthwatering salinity. Now if I could only afford to buy some... But if your budget swings to the mid-three digits for wine, this is one you'll want to enjoy. Let's come back to earth a bit with a couple of wines from Armenia, a country that may have been the place where mankind first figured out how to deliberately make wine at scale. With 6000 years of winemaking history under its belt, along with some very interesting native grapes, it's going through a renaissance of winemaking these days. The Voskevaz bottling of the white grape Voskehat and the NOA Wine bottling of Areni demonstrate this new wave of quality wine perfectly. Both are unique and delicious. A bit closer to home, I've got a pleasant Chardonnay from Trois Noix to recommend as well as a Grenache rose from Mathis Wines. Each fresh and ready for your late summer table. Santa Barbara winemaker Drake Whitcraft sent along a very special bottling of Pinot Noir from Jason Drew's vineyard up on Mendocino Ridge in Mendocino County, and boy is it a knockout of a wine. Silky, complex, vibrant, and delicious. Only one barrel of this stuff got made, but if you're looking for something special in Pinot Land, this is something to seek out. One of the things I like about Whitcraft's wines (and a few others that I consider to be the apogee of Pinot Noir in California) is their expression of beautiful fruit flavors at very modest alcohol levels. So many winemakers in California continue to state unequivocally that in order to get great flavor you must get optimal ripeness, which to the majority of people making Pinot Noir in California usually means making wines that clock in between 14% and 15% alcohol. When asked about picking earlier, these winemakers usually pull a face and talk about greenness and the lack of flavor development, etc., etc. Well, as an alternative to that point of view, I present Michael Cruse's 2021 Heintz Vineyard Pinot Noir, which, truth be told, was made originally to add some color to his Ultramarine rose sparkling wine. But it tasted so good, he decided to bottle some of it on its own as a still Pinot Noir. It's bursting with bright fruit flavor (yes, a bit on the nervy, sour-cherry side rather than black cherry, but hardly green and nasty). Alcohol level? A mere 10%. Try it, and see if you don't agree that flavor is not directly correlated with sugar. If you're in the mood for a reasonably priced, well-aged Italian wine, I tasted the 2018 Badia a Corte Riserva from Chianti producer Torre a Cona this week and found it quite tasty as it evolves into its secondary aromas and flavors. I generally try to review wines here that are already on the market (and typically ask producers to send me stuff that has been released or is just about to be released). I've got four wines to recommend to you this week that fall into that ""just about"" category. The first is the Durrell Vineyard Syrah from Gavin Chanin, another superstar from Santa Barbara dabbling in fruit from up north, in this case, the famed Durrell Vineyard in the Sonoma Coast AVA. Chanin's 2021 Syrah has lovely savory notes and a distinct cool-climate character while being quite accessible even in its youth. Lastly, I can't recommend highly enough that you take a look at the 2020 wines from Cathy Corison, which demonstrate all of the finesse and elegance that many of us have come to expect from Cathy. In what was a disastrous year for a majority of Napa Valley producers thanks to the horrible fires, Cathy had picked her Cabernet more than two weeks prior to the outbreak of the fires and was able to seal up her winery tight (and cautiously add some air filters) to allow the wines to avoid any threat of smoke taint. The resulting wines are positively tremendous, and demonstrate what an excellent vintage 2020 was until all hell broke loose for so many. Corison's 2020 Cabernet Sauvignon will be released in a few days, her Cabernet Franc in about a month, and her single vineyard Sunbasket Cabernet Sauvignon will be out in about 6 months, but I can tell you today just how good all of them are. Notes on these and all the rest below. 2021 Whitcraft Winery ""Sofia Romanee un Reve Devenu Realite - Fait de Mer Farm"" Pinot Noir, Mendocino Ridge, Mendocino County, CaliforniaMedium garnet in the glass, this wine smells of dried herbs, forest floor, and berries. In the mouth, incredibly bright and floral berry fruit is wrapped in gauzy tannins that stiffen over time and are shot through with herbs, dried flowers, and earth. Fantastic acidity and gorgeous aromatics. A fairly stunning wine. 13.57% alcohol. 22 cases made. Score: around 9.5. Cost: $165. 2021 Chanin Wine Company ""Durelll Vineyard"" Syrah, Sonoma Coast, Sonoma, CaliforniaMedium to dark garnet in the glass, this wine smells of black cherry and white pepper. In the mouth, blackberry and black cherry fruit mixes with aromatic white pepper and dried herbs as a cloud of powdery tannins fill the mouth. The tannins stiffen a little over time, but this is a surprisingly supple wine, with nice savory notes to balance the fruit. I find myself wishing for just a little more bite from the acidity, but that's just a quibble with a very attractive wine. 13% alcohol. 50 cases made. Score: between 9 and 9.5. Cost: $?? Not yet released."
"This week features a number of interesting California wines, ranging from classic to hip. In the former category, the Smith-Madrone Riesling never fails to deliver the kinds of flavors and stony qualities that make Riesling so beloved by many wine geeks. On the other end of the spectrum, it's hard to get more hip than a low-sulfite version of Picpoul Blanc from Two Shepherds winery with its limey, floral qualities. Two Shepherds also sent along two versions of Cinsault (or Cinsaut, as they spell it), one bright and lean and crunchy, the other darker and more substantial. Both are worth enjoying. Somewhere in the middle, more traditionally familiar, I've got a Sauvignon Blanc and a rose from Aesthete Wines, who make wines from their Dry Stack Vineyard in Sonoma's Bennett Valley. Their Sauvignon Blanc is tropically minded, while the rose (of Pinot Noir) is leaner and more savory in quality. Last but not least, I've got three more wines to recommend to you from the folks at Alegria Vineyards and Acorn Winery. Their Alvarinho (spelled the Portuguese way because there are lots of little bits of other Portuguese varieties in there) and their Gruner Veltliner are both pleasingly on target in conveying varietal character. And their Axiom Syrah, while showing a decent amount of oak at this point in its life, will likely mellow into something quite pleasing with a little time. Notes on all these below. 2022 Two Shepherds Wine ""L'il Trouble"" Cinsault, CaliforniaLight to medium garnet in the glass, this wine smells of cranberry and plum. In the mouth, cranberry, plum, and cherry flavors have a tangy sour cherry quality that is accompanied by mouthwatering acidity. Crunchy, juicy, and made to be drunk slightly chilled. Fermented with native yeasts, but given half the ""usual"" maceration time. Made with organic grapes, bottled unfined and unfiltered. 10.7% alcohol. 280 cases made. Score: between 8.5 and 9. Cost: $25."
"If there is one part of Santa Barbara County that most embodies everything that makes the region special, it's the Sta Rita Hills American Viticultural Area (always appearing as Sta Rita Hills on wine labels thanks to a compromise made with Chilean producer Santa Rita). It fully deserves its own tasting article both because its wines alone made up nearly half of those I tasted in my recent survey of Santa Barbara County wines, but also because the region itself stands apart both literally and figuratively from the other AVAs in Santa Barbara County. Far out on the western edge of the Santa Ynez Valley, the Sta Rita Hills AVA is actually comprised of two separate valleys sandwiched between three sets of hills, like two slices of luncheon meat alternating with three slices of bread. These two valleys, oriented directly west-to-east thanks to the region's unique tectonic past, funnel extremely cold marine air in the form of wind and fog towards warmer inland valleys to the east, creating positively frigid conditions at the western extremity of the AVA, and downright chilly climes throughout. 'What makes us really unique though, and this is the real takeaway, is the extremely long growing season here', says Chad Melville, of Melville Winery. 'We have budbreak at the end of February and we're still harvesting Syrah deep into November. So it's a really long growth season. The reason why that works is because it's sunny and cold. That's the thing to remember about the Santa Rita Hills: it's cold sunshine.' In addition to its unusually cool climate, the region boasts two important soil characteristics that contribute to the unique character of its wines. Throughout the AVA, it is possible to find large swathes of relatively loose, deep sandy soils that in some places turn to pure sand. These drifts are scattered throughout the AVA, but are most prominently found in the area occupied by Melville Winery in the heart of the AVA. More visible than the sand, however, and much more unusual, are the large outcrops of brilliant white compacted soil that most wine lovers, myself included, will immediately assume are calcareous. Despite looking identical to the chalk that you might find peeking out from beneath thin layers of topsoil in Champagne, there's not a bit of calcium to be found in this white substance known as diatomaceous earth.

"Santa Barbara was launched into the consciousness of most mainstream wine drinkers 19 years ago with the release of the film Sideways. Despite a starring role in that narrative, however, Santa Barbara continues to be undervalued as a fine wine region, perhaps in part due to its size and complexity. But make no mistake about it, Santa Barbara now makes some of California's finest wines. The sheer diversity of wines made in Santa Barbara County can make the region a challenge for many wine lovers who understandably find comfort in straightforward notions about what is good, where: Napa does Cabernet. Sonoma does Pinot. Lodi does Zinfandel. 'What I love about Santa Barbara County is the diversity', says Jessica Gasca, winemaker and owner of the boutique wine label Story of Soil. 'That diversity put Santa Barbara on the map to pay attention to. We know Burgundy, Rhone, Bordeaux, but we are young and it's the wild west out here. We're a newer generation pioneering fun with new grapes, making things differently, and trying new things.' Santa Barbara credibly produces outstanding cool-climate Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, excellent renditions of Rhone varieties in the styles of both the northern and southern Rhone, and even a few truly excellent Cabernet Sauvignons. Such diversity is a strength, but one that strays quickly into complexity when it comes to telling the story of the region as a whole. In fact, there is no single reductive story that can be told about Santa Barbara. Instead, it is a region much better understood in terms of its individual subregions and the geological forces that have made them what they are.

"This week we've got a bunch of Chenin Blanc to talk about. None of us, I'd wager, are drinking enough Chenin Blanc. It's simply one of the greatest grapes around. It can be made into sweet wines and sparkling wines, but I like me some plain 'ole dry Chenin Blanc, like the bottles of Savennieres and Vouvray I have to recommend to you this week. The first two wines, especially, from Domaine du Closel - Chateau des Vaults are both excellent and worthy of seeking out. This certified biodynamic estate, run by Evelyne de Pontbriand, is a gem, and in addition to having beautiful grounds, it is one of the few estates in Savennieres where you can simply drop by without an appointment to taste. From farther east along the Loire, I can recommend these two dry Vouvrays as well, which are slightly richer than their stony Savennieres cousins, but equally bright and refreshing. The tiny Domaine de la Canopee is run by Jeremy Lajoux, who doesn't even have a website, preferring to stick with Instagram. Chateau Moncontour, on the other hand, has been around for a while and is better known for their sparkling wines than their still, dry Chenins. Before we head into red wine territory, I have one more Chenin Blanc for you, this one from Mendocino County, made by Taylor Berkley Boydstun, whose T Berkeley label takes inspiration from the Loire, and tends to focus on grape varieties from the region. His Chenin doesn't have the snap of the Loire bottlings above, but it is varietally correct and tasty. In addition, Boydstun sent along a couple of Cabernet Francs which are both quite interesting, and manage to have both Loire and California sensibilities. I like that they have distinctly savory components along with their fruit. Many wine lovers will know that Thomas Jefferson was america's first wine geek, and that he even planted vines at his estate in Monticello. Fewer will know that Virginia has a thriving wine country and several sub-AVAs. I was sent some Virginia wines a while back--the winners of the state's annual Governor's Cup wine competition--and I found a few bottles that I'm pleased to recommend. Barboursville Vineyards is perhaps one of Virginia's best known producers, and its longest-running, having been purchased and planted by Gianni Zonin (of the Zonin prosecco empire in Italy) in 1976. It's perhaps no surprise, then, that their Vermentino is worth drinking. On some of the very same land that Jefferson tried so hard to turn into vineyards, the appropriately named Jefferson Vineyards has finally made his dreams come true, having planted vineyards beginning in 1981. Their red blend will definitely appeal to drinkers of rich red wine. This blend carries the designation Meritage (pronounced like ""heritage""), which is a particular designation for a Bordeaux-style blend in which no single grape makes up more than 90% of the blend. The Pollack Vineyards Meritage shows more of its Cabernet Franc pedigree with nuttier tones, while the Barren Ridge Vineyards Petite Sirah offers deeper blueberry flavors for those looking for darker, richer wines. Last but not least, I've got a couple of wines to recommend to you from Acorn Winery, run by Bill and Betsy Nachbaur, who farm one of Sonoma's oldest vineyards south of Healdsburg. Planted in 1890, their Alegria heritage vineyard of primarily Zinfandel contains fifty or sixty other grape varieties. The winery specializes in field blends of different sorts, and I'm recommending two of them today. Their Zinfandel, which is a cofermentation of many of the different grapes from their old vine block dominated by Zinfandel, and their Medley, which is a more equal cofermentation of a bunch of red and white grape varieties. That's it for this week. Notes on all these below! 2020 Domaine de la Canopee ""Clariere Sec"" Vouvray, Touraine, Loire, FrancePalest gold in the glass, this wine smells of lemon pith and pear flesh. In the mouth, bright grapefruit and quince flavors mix with a hint of pear skin. Good acidity. Score: around 8.5.

"This week included a lot of refreshing wines of many colors, so let's dive in! Spottswoode Winery in Napa makes two Sauvignon Blancs, one from their estate that as fantastic as it is pricey, and another one that is more reasonably priced, easier to get ahold of, and sourced from various vineyards they don't own. It also happens to be nearly as delicious as their estate wine, so I'm happy to recommend that this week. I've also got three different Chenin Blancs to recommend from France's Loire Valley. The first, a Savennieres from Domaine du Closel is wonderfully bright and stony. The other two are Vouvrays from farther east in the Loire Valley, and are just slightly riper in character, though still deliver wonderful refreshment. Of the two, I liked the more brisk Domaine Sebastien Brunet (a steal at just $18) just slightly more than the Domaine Philippe Brisebarre, but I'd happily drink a bottle of both without thinking twice. The Ribeira Sacra region of Spain is high on my bucket list of wine regions that I have yet to visit, so I was quite excited to see this Paul Hobbs and Antonio Lopez Fernandez collaboration wine, Alvaredos-Hobbs, show up in the samples pile. It was wonderfully bright and saline, but also with richer riper fruit flavors making it quite compelling. When winemaker Stewart Johnson dropped off a bottle of his latest Kendric Vineyards Viognier on my porch, he said offhandedly, ""Oh, you're probably going to ding me for the bottle weight, so I should explain."" Johnson knows that I dislike heavy glass and its carbon footprint, and he went on to tell me that he was still unable to order his normal glass bottles thanks to continued pandemic-related supply chain issues, so he cast about for an alternative and found some surplus glass that someone else was reselling at half his usual bottle cost. ""So when you think about it,"" said Johnson, ""I'm something of an environmental hero for putting their wastefulness to some use, right?"" Unfortunately buying surplus glass doesn't do anything about the carbon footprint of moving that glass around once it's got wine in it, but Johnson gets points (and avoids castigation) for his secondhand sourcing, for sure. Oh, and the wine? It's delicious, and easily one of the best renditions of the Viognier grape in California. Troon Vineyard makes regular appearances here in my Unboxed feature both because they regularly send me wine and because the wines are very good. The latest set they sent were particularly tasty, one and all, from their palest-of-pale rose, to their easygoing-but-clearly-in-form orange wine, to their crunchy porch-pounder version of Grenache. All, of course, bioynamically produced and grown with certified Regenerative Organic farming. There's another rose in the lineup this week I can recommend, from the small producer Minus Tide Wines, it's a rose of Carignan from Mendocino County, and just what you might want on a hot day. Lastly, I have one red wine to offer you this week, a blend of international grape varieties from the Bolgheri region of Tuscany by Podere Sapaio that is rich in flavor, while at the same time, nicely dry and herb inflected, and likely to satisfy those who enjoy big red wines but don't want them sweetish at all. Notes on all these below. 2022 Minus Tide Wines ""Feliz Creek Vineyard"" Rose of Carignan, Mendocino County, CaliforniaLight baby pink in the glass, this wine smells of cherries and candied plums. In the mouth, silky flavors of cherry and plum mix with citrus peel and a touch of white flowers. Very good acidity. Crisp and clean. 13.1% alcohol.  Score: between 8.5 and 9. Cost: $27."
"For many people in the world of wine, Nicolas Joly needs no introduction. But the average wine lover may not have encountered Joly or his wines, as they exist, by design, far outside the mainstream of commercial wine. Joly lives and farms just outside the town of Savennieres, in France's Loire Valley. As a winegrower, he is known for two things: his family's ownership of the 16-acre Clos de Coulee de Serrant, a walled vineyard so famously old and singular that it merits its own tiny appellation, and for being one of the earliest adherents of and proselytizers for biodynamic viticulture. After reading Rudolph Steiner's Anthroposophical lectures on farming in the late 1970s and early 1980's, Joly converted his family estate to biodynamic viticulture, and thanks to both his voluble nature and his strong belief in the practice, Joly quickly became one of the most important figures in biodynamic viticulture. His 2005 book, Wine from Sky to Earth, was for many years the reference guide to biodynamic wine growing, and he has written many since. Joly has attained something of a prophet-like status in the world of biodynamics, helped by the fact that much of the time he seems to speak like a prophet, describing forces at work in the world far outside the everyday consciousness of mankind. When I visited the Loire last year, I made a point to stop by La Coulee de Serrant, where I found Joly busy trying to get the well in the back of his house into shape. Satisfied that things were going smoothly, he broke away to say hello to me, and offered to sit down and chat a bit after finding out I was a wine writer. Sitting down with Nicolas Joly seems less a conversation than a hearkening, as he weaves a narrative encompassing many realms. What follows is my best attempt to capture the thoughts he decided to share with me on a beautiful spring day. Or, put another way, I shut up, and this is what he said while I listened. I have edited Joly's words for grammar and clarity, and in two or three places I have rearranged the sequence of his narrative to avoid extreme tangents. ""How do you express a place? If you want to have a good end product, you shouldn't worry about farming. There are now 320 tastes we can put into wines, so you don't need to worry too much about the expression of the soil and photosynthesis. We've known for 30 years that we have the right to use aromatic yeasts, achieved through genetics. It's very flattering for wine. The new thing is that you can add the taste of slate, did you know? You have two sorts of good wine. Those where the place doesn't speak, and where the enologue has been creating something appealing. The taste is brought in the cellar. Sometimes smartly brought, but it is not the full local taste. These are good wines. I call them Appellation Control l'Oreal. You know, like the cosmetics? This is legal. One thing I could add regarding Demeter, the strictest is Demeter America. Demeter France, and Demeter Austria have been forbidding aromatic yeasts. But not in Germany. Did you know you can have a Demeter wine in Germany with aromatic yeasts, which are completely changing the expression of the appellation? People don't know that. I discussed this with Germany for 7 or 8 years. People are now accustomed to this wine profile so we can't move backwards they say. This is a drama which the consumer doesn't realize in many cases. Farming should become an art. The art of connecting the place to the forces it needs so that it fully express the originality of the place The two next questions, is if you want your cellar to be like maternity, where you follow what happens, rather than a hospital [where you treat a sickness], it's very important to go into the detail of these very subtle processes, which permit the place, the soil and the climate, to be fully there in the grape. In other words the vine doesn't work for you. It is creating seeds. These seeds are carrying the essence of the place. You can write a book about that."" ""Right now in Coulee de Serrant we have 10 centimeter buds. Hopefully in 6 months they will become grapes. It's extremely interesting to understand how this happens, when you take a few tons of matter that appear on one hectare every year. One day you have nothing then a while later you have a crop. If you take the water away, what are you left with? This is dry matter. The key point to understand here is that photosynthesis is 94% and the soil is only 6%. This means that most of what you have in the bottle, taste wise, comes from the atmosphere, it comes from the upper part. If you want to avoid technology in the cellar the task is to bring enough reception forces for the vine so that all these upper qualities will become matter into the grapes. It's really helping a process of incarnation. Incarnating forces into matter. This is where biodynamie is efficient. Then you should have a sort of song in your juice and the key point is.... please don't touch it. Please don't control the temperature. Re-yeasting is murder of what is a vintage. You take a poor yeast born in the darkness of the laboratory, you ask that yeast to convert something from the world it doesn't know into a wine. The first act of this lab yeast is to die. Each preparation we use [in biodynamics] is connecting the place to to each planet, and each planet is creating a specificity in your climate and soils, in terms of microorganisms.  This is where I'm very much defending farming should become an art. The art of connecting the place to the forces it needs so that it fully express the originality of the place. Whether we're talking about cheese or with specific animals. All the academic teaching these days is finally orientated towards higher yields, better profitability, satisfaction of the consumer at the expense of the greatness of what is an appellation."" ""But these changes are 30 years old. Whether you were living in Alaska or Chile fifty years ago you were tasting a bottle of more of less good wine, you at least had the originality of a tiny place that was protected worldwide. This concept is extraordinary. How much of this is left? Very little. Are you touching your heart, is there someone speaking in the bottle? Or is it a cold cleverness? You kill the soil through weedkillers. These are not affecting the roots. These are destroying the microorganisms of the soil and the connections that the root needs to feed itself on the soil, over 5 to 7 years. The next step is you have no growth in your vines. But for that you have chemical fertilizer. These fertilizers are salts. When you eat a teaspoon of salt, you need water. You are thirsty. The growth you achieve through chemical fertilizer is a growth borne of water. It is growth through water. When a plant has something which is not balanced, it gets diseased. Disease is an indication of a problem. Now you have many subtle diseases for vines. So what did people do? Copper and sulfur were not strong enough, so they invent systemics, these are extremely efficient, molecules synthesized that can go into the sap within 30 minutes. The positive point with synthetics is that you don't get disease, you protect your vines. But the negative side is that you are poisoning the system that creates photosynthesis, you're cutting the link to the soil and the link to the climate. What you need is urgently, technology, for creating for the consumer, something that is appealing with no place of origin."" ""Here's is the test of truth. You follow the wine. You drink a glass, another glass, and then you wait and have another glass three days later. In summer, all true wines will improve for 8 or 9 days. In winter they can improve for 2 or 3 weeks. Is the wine better? This shows you if life forces are still in the bottle or if they have been destroyed by the farming and someone was obliged to use enology to create the wine. We have to rediscover step-by-step through our heads and hearts and wills how we can play a positive part that can end up in a wine. Economically it is very important to understand that commercially this approach to farming was immensely profitable. Look at the evolution of yields over 30 years. You can go into the town halls in French villages and see declarations of yields. It's been doubled or tripled in recent decades. When you create the taste in the cellar, you don't have to prune short. When I taste a wine -- we do blind tasting every Sunday -- you should shortcut all your head and feeling and see your emotion. Are you touching your heart, is there someone speaking in the bottle? Or is it a cold cleverness? It is important in my mind to cover the details which permit us not to use enology. This is important and it can be pushed very far. The basic idea? Monoculture is a drama for nature. How do you fight it? The idea is to have places where you have no vines. One field for horses, one for goats. If you are in a place where one hectare costs you a million dollars it's much harder. Here I could extend my production with trees, with fields. If you receive, a big vineyard, you are obliged to cope with it. You can't be as strict with it as you can with something smaller. It shouldn't be an ecology as advertising. Which is very often. The main ecology is within you to link to the forces that allow you to be a green thumb. We have to rediscover step-by-step through our heads and hearts and wills how we can play a positive part that can end up in a wine. The second thing, which is extremely important. There are 4 levels of life -- minerality, plants, animals, human, and on top of that, what is explained by Steiner as 9 levels of life, these 9 levels are expressed in the biodynamic preparation. You are not obliged to understand this to practice biodynamics by the way. The diversity of animals is a key point for the full expression of place. Not just manure, though that is better than nothing The presence of these animals is itself important. Your place should be an organism, and the more notes of music you have through diversity of animals and plants, the deeper will be the music of your wine."" ""I can add these four things. You have 4 types of animals, 4 levels of matter. You have animals linked to earth such as the pig. A pig will act on the root. Cows which are linked to liquids, the manure and presence of cows act on the leaves and sap. Then on top you have animals linked to light -- sheep and goats will act on the flowering system. Last you have animals linked to heat -- horses. Horses create mushrooms. You could push it further with birds and insects. There is an art to understanding the living agents of your place. This is an earthly process. You have to decide according to your senses, to your place. The presence of a donkey on an estate is essential. I was always wondering in my life why there was a donkey in a creche. When you have a donkey.... Hmm. Talk to people who have a donkey. It has its place. Then it is a thinking process. Try to use local animals. The presence of animals is as important as the manure. People think it is about the manure. It's notes of music that creates harmony, photosynthesis and the soil microorganisms will have more power through this diversity. This place [Clos de Coulee de Serrant] has 9 centuries of vines. Monks. It's important when you come to a place, there is a memory of a place. Having the Cistercians, they are monks linked to the earth. Most monks pray. But Cistercians would probably say we are human beings with capital ""H"" our duty is to bring life to the place. They were working on life expression of the place. That's why you have many interesting places panted by Cistercians. Vines are an earthy plant. Wheat rises to the sun. Sometimes you prune vines very low, or very high you will have different wines. When people in Portugal have vines in trees climbing to 4 meters, you have a different grape. Farming should be an art. When you have for centuries, monks, there is a past, and your part is to improve or at the very least to respect that past, and second to express that past through actualization. You are a being of your century. You cannot return to the past. When all this is done, the last point is to consider when do you harvest. Once you have the juice, the result of all your work, please make sure you don't interfere. I find it shocking to make analysis of grapes. This is an earthly process. You have to decide according to your senses, to your place. You decide when harvest is right. Clones are an absurdity. When you travel with 4 friends you are happy to talk with them. If you were all the same you'd get bored. When you have real massale selection, you are obliged to do at least three harvests, sometimes four. The key point here is that when you taste grapes, on the same spot, with the same maturity, one week later, three weeks later, the taste is different. All those maturities are the same. The hints are to tell how to create complexity, so that once you have the juice, the result of all your work, please make sure you don't interfere. Fermentation can last 3 or 4 months. Sometimes 5 months. Let it happen. What do you do after. One or two racking. Very loose filtration if you worry that some people don't accept small amounts of sediment. Then bottle the bloody thing. Full stop. The key is what happens before, not what you do in the cellar. The meaning of life, as a human being, is that you are trying to give your forces to the expression of the earth The work in the cellar here is at most 3 weeks a year. I respect the point of view of everyone. The greatest quality of a human being is freedom. But this side of human beings should also develop, which is what is the meaning of life? The meaning of life, as a human being, is that you are trying to give your forces to the expression of the earth. The key question being, we are human from birth to death. After we are losing our body, you are submitted to rules that are very different. This is where for me Steiner is important. I became a Buddhist, born a Catholic. When I found Anthroposophy, I got a feeling of being linked to the upper world and using my humanity in farming. All this is a summary for these young people who have difficulty to find their lives in this crazy world that is more crazy every year, I see very interesting sommelier, wine school students, you find among these people who are on earth to serve the earth. This is what I try to defend and express."" Here are a few tasting notes on recently released wines from the Joly family. The family makes three Chenin Blanc wines: La Coulee de Serrant, from the famous walled vineyard with its own AOC; Le Clos de la Bergerie which carries the Savennieres Roche aux Moines appellation and is made from an east-facing vineyard across from Coulee de Serrant between the Joly home and their neighbor Domaine Aux Moines; and Les Vieux Clos, which is made from vineyards surrounding the Joly home and carries the Savennieres appellation. For those unfamiliar with the Joly winemaking style, it is simultaneously as enigmatic and as simple as the man himself. The wines are fairly oxidative, often feature the influence of botrytis, tend towards the rustic and yet are extremely long-lived. They most certainly are not for everyone, tending to elicit rather strong responses, even among wine professionals, who tend to either adore them, or avoid them. I had my first taste of La Coulee de Serrant courtesy of a sommelier during my first visit to Charlie Trotters in Chicago more than two decades ago. I don't remember which vintage I was served, but I do remember that the wine was 14 years old at the time, and my first question to the sommelier was ""is it supposed to taste like this?"" The answer was, and still is, yes. You, however, get to decide whether you like it or not. 2013 Clos de la Bergerie, Savennieres Roche aux Moines, Loire Valley, FranceLight to medium gold in the glass with hints of amber, this wine smells of candied citrus peel, kumquat and honey. In the mouth, exotic citrus flavors mix with wet stones, herbs, and a faint chalky texture. Excellent acidity and depth. Quite complex. A hot year, but a good harvest. Aged for 8 months in barrel. 13.5% alcohol. Score: around 9. One of the trends in the wine world that I've been happiest to see in recent years is the surge"
"For those of you who are (apparently like the rest of the world) excited about California Sauvignon Blanc, you'll find a lot to love in the rendition from Barnett Vineyards, who can be found at the top of Spring Mountain in Napa, but who have gone over the hill to Dry Creek Valley to source their fruit for their Andrews Vineyard version of the wine. Think liquid passionfruit and flowers. Speaking of floral, there's a lot to like in the Muscadelle (also known sometimes as Sauvignon Vert) from Moret Brealynn, who wants you to enjoy your floral melon glass of crisp goodness while donating money (from every bottle) to animal shelters. Likewise, the reliably tasty Pinot Gris from Kathleen Inman in Russian River, has a touch of floral quality along with its pear and herbal qualities. Graham Tatomer has been making some of California's best Rieslings for some time. Most are dry or off-dry, but occasionally he manages to get some excellent late-harvest fruit, as the little (375ml) bottle from the Kick-on Ranch demonstrates, with the lightness and cleanliness that great acidity can bring to even a very sweet wine. I've got a couple of Chardonnays to recommend to you this week as well. The first is a quaffer that will also be easy on the pocketbook from Ron Rubin, who produces an un-oaked version to keep his wife Pam happy. The second is a much more ambitious bottling, from Neely Wines in Portola Valley, whose Bee Block is typically my favorite of their single-vineyard, block-designated Chardonnays. And before we dive into red wine, let's make a brief stop in orange territory. Namely the skin-fermented Picpoul pet-nat from Two Shepherds Winery with the very cute name (to accompany its cute can): Natty Pets. With a nice fizz, a touch of tannic grip, and some fun apricot fruitiness, this is a very successful canned wine. For 8 bucks? Come on! Finally, I've got three Pinot Noirs of note. The first is a new (to me) bottling from Dutton-Goldfield that they call Mendocino Hills, from a few sources in Mendocino county that deliver some nice cranberry and cherry character. The other two wines are a new collaboration between Pinot veteran Adam Lee (of Siduri fame) and grower John Wagner in Santa Barbara County. These two wines offer a lot of bang for their buck, with bright fruit flavors for $25-35--an impressive feat in California Pinot Noir. Notes on all these below. 2021 Tatomer ""Kick-on Ranch"" Late Harvest Riesling, Santa Barbara County, CaliforniaPalest gold in the glass, this wine smells of candied citrus peel and honey. In the mouth, wonderfully bright honey and mandarin orange peel flavors are so vibrant with acidity that it's hard to believe there are 70 grams per liter of residual sugar here. Finishes clean and bright. Mouthwatering. 10.2% alcohol. 375ml bottle. Score: around 9. Cost: $??"
"This week included a whole bunch of pink wines. But before we get into that hue, I can recommend a sparkling wine from the Russian River producer Inman Family Wines. Winemaker and owner Kathleen Inman has made a fresh-tasting extra-brut wine from a combination of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. Further south, in the cool Santa Cruz Mountains, consulting winemaker Shalini Sekhar makes Neely Wines from their vineyard in Portola Valley. Their Holly's Cuvee Chardonnay has a nice balance to it with notes of herbs and minerality. OK, shall we talk pink wine? I got a handful of rosatos from Italy recently, thanks to importer Dalla Terra. They're all very good, and an excellent reminder not to have Provencal tunnel vision when it comes to refreshing pink wine. In particular, the rosatos of Puglia in the heel of Italy's boot are especially excellent, as the two wines from Masseria Li Veli this week demonstrated. Both the Torrerose, which is made from Negroamaro, and the Susumaniello rosatos are excellent. The Susumaniello, in particular, has this gorgeous floral quality that will sweep you off your feet. Farther north, the pink wines from Capezzana in Tuscany, Garofoli in the Marche, and Scaia in the Veneto are all very tasty, as well as excellent values. There's also a domestic rose to pay attention to, thanks to a bottle of Grenache-dominant rose from Quivira, the organic producer in Dry Creek Valley. Moving into reds, I've got another mountain Grenache to recommend from producer Edio Vineyards at Delfina Farms in El Dorado County, who have a crunchy, stony interpretation of the grape in this bottle. From lower elevations, I can recommend the Cabernet Sauvignon from Sutro Wines in Alexander Valley, a producer who is maybe better known for their Merlot. Finally, Rosemary Cakebread sent along her Gallica estate Cabernet Sauvignon from 2020, a vintage that many in Napa Valley did not produce. This wine is quite elegant and poised, though perhaps not quite as dynamic as it could be. I can't wait to taste the 2021 version. Notes on all these below. 2018 Inman Family Wines ""Luxe Cuvee - Extra Brut - Inman Sisters"" Sparkling Wine, Russian River Valley, Sonoma, CaliforniaLight yellow-gold in the glass with coarse aggressive bubbles, this wine smells of freshly cut apples and lemon pith. In the mouth, lemon peel, apples, and a faint chalkiness turn slightly salty as the wine finishes. The mousse is extremely voluminous, almost too much so, filling the mouth even with a delicate sip. Good acidity, with a tart green apple note in the finish. A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. 13% alcohol. Score: around 8.5. Cost: $90. click eto buy. 2020 Neely ""Holly's Cuvee"" Chardonnay Santa Cruz Mountains, CaliforniaLight to medium yellow-gold in the glass, this wine smells of lemon curd and yellow herbs. In the mouth, lemon peel, lemon curd, and pomelo flavors have a nice yellow-herb tinge to them. Delicate acidity (wish there was more) supports and balances the fruit and herbal tones. Faint sense of minerality. 13.9% alcohol. 44 cases made. Score: around 8.5. Cost: $55. 2020 Edio Vineyards ""Estate Blend"" Grenache, El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, CaliforniaLight ruby in color, this wine smells of strawberries and a hint of something meatier. In the mouth, strawberries mix with saddle leather and a touch of dried herbs as bright acidity and lightly grippy tannins make for a crunchier quality. 14.1% alcohol. Score: around 8.5. Cost: $40."
"With global rose sales on a steady rise (to the point that they seemingly threaten to overtake red-wine consumption in France) it can be hard to believe that less than 20 years ago, California rose producers felt the need to create a collective marketing organisation in order to convince consumers to buy pink wines. Known as RAP, Rose Avengers and Producers, this group was launched in 2005 largely in reaction to the massive popularity of White Zinfandel. According to its (now defunct) website, the organisation was: 'An international group of winemakers and wine drinkers dedicated to righting the wrongs done to dry rose. In Europe, they down copious amounts of pink wine, perhaps the most versatile of all food wines. But what gives in the States? Except for a handful of savvy drinkers, too many Americans would still rather buy a mediocre white or red instead of a great rose. It's bizarre.' Already a rose enthusiast myself, and at that time a budding wine blogger, I eagerly attended the yearly 'Pink Out' tastings put on by this group, only to emerge from the first few events scratching my head. While this collective group may have put European (and in particular French) rose on a pedestal, they sure weren't doing a very good job emulating the form, at least to my palate. To put it bluntly, in 2005 most California rose sucked.

"This week included some wines that you don't see all that often, along with something of a lesson in quality-to-price ratio. I recently received a couple of sample bottles of Bordeaux Blanc. I wasn't familiar with either producer, but Bordeaux Blanc is something of a rarity for me, certainly when it comes to samples, but also in terms of what I come across on wine lists, in stores, etc. I just don't see a lot of these wines, though perhaps that will start changing given the current Sauvignon Blanc craze sweeping America. In any case, I pulled these two bottles out and opened them up. One with a cork, one with a screw cap. I tasted them both. They were both pretty tasty. Not amazing, but pretty tasty. The first one from Chateau Couhins had a slightly smoky note that suggested expensive oak barrels, the Chateau la Freynelle by Veronique Barthe a lovely fruity freshness. I gave both of them the same score. And then imagine my surprise when I found out one of them was $250 per bottle and one of them was $15! My friends, you don't always get what you pay for. Especially in the world of wine. In keeping with the ""you don't see these every day"" theme, I also got a pair of Albarinos this week. Considering the furor over Sauvignon Blanc at the moment, perhaps we're also about to see the stars align for an explosion of Albarino? Equally refreshing and with a similar flavor profile, Albarino is just much less common in California, though it's been around for decades. The two wines I received represent two equally compelling interpretations of the grape, so to speak. The Croma Vera version is fruitier, perhaps more ""California"" in style, but with the bright acidity and snap you expect from the variety. The Edio Vineyards version is more in tune with the Rias Baixas version of Albarino, lean and steely. There's an irony here, in that the Croma Vera comes from the SLO Coast, a climate that much better resembles the grape's homeland in coastal northern Spain, whereas the Edio is grown in a high-elevation mountain climate in El Dorado county. Keep an eye out for the tasty GSM ""Frank's Blend"" from Edio as well. I also tasted a couple more wines this week from Darling Wines--a very lean Pinot Gris and an interesting Pinot Noir, both from the Petaluma Gap AVA. Moving to the darker shade of reds, we can begin with a crunchy, surprisingly (in a good way) lean interpretation of Nero d'Avola from the Perlegos brothers in Lodi, as well as a classically profiled Cabernet Sauvignon from Post & Beam, which is a sub-brand of Far Niente winery in Napa. It's tough to taste Barolo's when they're too young, and the bottle of Pio Cesare ""Barolo Pio"" that got sent to me recently is a good example, but this one will likely blossom with some time in the bottle. Lastly, and certainly not least, I recently received the latest vintage of Insignia from Joseph Phelps. Their flagship Cabernet-dominant red blend is reliably one of Napa's top bottlings every year and one that (though expensive) is made in quantities that allow ordinary humans (or at least humans who can afford it) to get their hands on a bottle without being on a mailing list. The 2019 vintage is beautifully accessible now but will improve for the next 10 years for sure. Notes on all these below. 2020 Edio Vineyards Albarino, El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, CaliforniaPalest gold in the glass with a hint of green, this wine smells of green apple and wet steel. In the mouth, bright green apple flavors have a stony, wet-chalkboard quality as excellent acidity and hints of lime zest linger in the finish. Classically profiled. 13.7% alcohol. Score: between 8.5 and 9. Cost: $28."
"This week included a bunch of really fun wines that I'm excited to recommend to you. Let's start, as one always should, with bubbles. Most people don't think often of the North Fork of Long Island when it comes to wine, especially not when it comes to sparkling wine. But not only is there some excellent sparkling wine made there, there's even a winery dedicated to it, named Sparkling Pointe. Their Brut Nature has a nicely lean profile. In my opinion, Cuvaison's sparkling wines have been improving in recent years, and their most recent rose release amply demonstrates this with its friendly and energetic berries and wonderfully bright sour cherry acidity. Brunch anyone? If you had told me years ago that the hottest ticket in California wine would one day be Sauvignon Blanc, I would have laughed in your face. I'm still shaking my head at this phenomenon, but apparently, everyone wants to buy it, and the wineries can't make enough of it. So if you're one of the folks contributing to the shortage here's another candidate for your consideration, the Chalk Hill Estate Sauvignon Blanc. It's faintly sweet, which I don't care for, but most people won't even notice as they glug it chilled on a hot day. A couple of nice whites from Oregon also arrived recently. The Spiral white wine from the biodynamic Cowhorn estate is a pretty and delicious Rhone-style blend of Marsanne, Roussanne, and Viognier. A bit farther north, winemaker Jerry Murray makes a tasty Chardonnay named ""Annica"" from the Eola-Amity Hills at his Project M Wines brand. It's got a wonderfully juicy lemon profile that will likely age quite well. Murray's Pinot Noir from the Tulatin Hills is even more compelling than the Chardonnay, offering a wonderful crystalline purity that will appeal to any serious Pinot lover. Two Shepherds also sent along their old-vine Carignan from Trimble Vineyard in Mendocino, and it has a lot to offer, especially for anyone who enjoys the berry-cola notes of Dr. Pepper. Another wine that might compete very well in the ""fun"" category of eminently drinkable and delicious wines that don't require much from the drinker would be the Rosso Piceno from the Marche family of Garafoli. At $15 this wine is an absolute steal for all its bright cherry deliciousness. Closer to home, I have two more wines from the Perlegos brothers, who farm their family's vineyards in Lodi, including the ancient Zinfandel vines of the Stampede Vineyard, which is one of Lodi's old vineyard treasures. The Perlegos Wines Cinsaut was tasty and bright. Still, the 2020 vintage of their Stampede Zinfandel is positively stupendous--just bursting with bright fruit, and vibrating with fantastic acidity and a deliciously reasonable alcohol level of 14.1%. It's definitely one of the better mouthfuls of Zinfandel I've had in a while. If you've not had a glass of Zinfandel in a while, try this wine and remember why that's a damn shame. Lastly, I've got a few top-tier (but still ""affordable"" at least by local standards) Napa Cabernets to recommend. The Baldacci ""Black Label"" Cabernet Sauvignon is straightforwardly satisfying with its combination of polish, oak influence, and dark fruit. Those who appreciate broad-shouldered, more powerful Cabernet will enjoy this wine. Those who appreciate slightly leaner Cabernet that shows some green herbs in addition to lush cherry fruit may appreciate the ""Paramount"" bottlings from Gamble Family Vineyards. Both the 2017 and 2018 share restrained alcohol levels, and seem to have been picked for freshness rather than opulence. I favored the 2017, which is evolving nicely, but both wines are worth checking out. Notes on all these below. 2021 Perlegos Family Wines Cinsaut, Clements Hills, Lodi, CaliforniaLight to medium garnet in color, this wine smells of cherry and blackberry. In the mouth, bright black cherry and boysenberry flavors are shot through with citrus peel and even some orange juice notes. A touch of cola and licorice root linger in the finish along with bright juicy acidity. Tasty. Includes some whole cluster fermentation, with native yeasts. 12.2% alcohol. 100 cases made. Score: between 8.5 and 9. Cost: $28. 2020 Perlegos Family Wines ""Stampede Vineyard"" Zinfandel, Clements Hills, Lodi, CaliforniaLight to medium garnet in the glass, this wine smells of bright blackberry fruit and flowers. In the mouth, the wine has a wonderful juiciness, with faint tannins backing up blackberry, boysenberry, and blueberry flavors that are lit up with excellent acidity. There's a lightness and freshness here that is extremely compelling. Hints of licorice root and dried herbs in the finish along with a touch of citrus peel. Effortlessly joyous. This vineyard was planted in the 1920s and features an unusual diamond-shaped spacing between its old gnarled vines. 14.1% alcohol.  Score: between 9 and 9.5. Cost: $32."
"This week included a couple of wines from Desparada, a project by winemaker Vailia From on the Central Coast. The wines are on the richer, bolder side of things, and deliberately experimental. My favorite of the wines I tasted last week was the amphora-aged Sauvignon Blanc, which had a liveliness I appreciated. Dutton-Goldfield also sent along their Dutton Ranch Chardonnay, which is a reasonably-priced crowd-pleaser for those interested in California Chardonnay that bucks the stereotypes. Gerard Bertrand is a former rugby star with a nose for brand building. He's recently released his first orange wine, which comes in a fancy faceted bottle, and is quite pleasant. It's definitely a gateway orange wine, with very little tannic grip to speak of. But for $20, it will likely satisfy a lot of people interested in dipping their toes into the skin-macerated white wine category. I recently got a 750ml sample of a wine that apparently is only sold in magnum: the Hawkbox Rose, which is a new label from Reed Skupny (son of John and Tracey Skupny of Lang & Reed wines) and his wife Megan. This one is a rose of Pinot Noir from Bien Nacido Vineyards that hits all the right notes. Speaking of Pinot Noir from Bien Nacido, I was introduced recently to the El Lugar project by winemaker Coby Parker- Garcia. A bunch of his wines from the SLO Coast will be included in my forthcoming article for Jancis Robinson, but he also threw a Bien Nacido Pinot into the box he sent me, so I'm happy to review that below with great enthusiasm. Larkmead Vineyards is a relatively well-known name in Napa Valley Cabernet, appreciated for its more restrained winemaking style. In a year when many did not make red wine at all, their 2020 Cabernet Sauvignon is excellent, showing a nice balance between fresh, green herbal tones and ripe fruit. I'm also happy to recommend a lighthearted red wine from Brunello producer Casanova di Neri. They have taken their beloved Sangiovese grape and blended in some Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Verdot to make what we used to call a Super Tuscan. But unlike those massive, rich wines of the late 1990s and early 2000s, their ""IrRosso"" is cheerful and easy drinking. Lastly, I've got a couple of red wines from Jeff and John Perlegos, who own one of Lodi's most historic vineyards, and who make interesting and sometimes unexpected wines in Lodi. Their Stampede Vineyard Zinfandel is classic in style, and their red blend is quite tasty. Notes on all these below. 2021 Desparada ""Suitor"" Red Blend, Central Coast, CaliforniaVery dark garnet in color, this wine smells of mocha and plum. In the mouth, plum, mocha, and cola flavors have a nice bright acidity to them, as well as a faint herbal backdrop. Muscular tannins hang on the edges and back of the palate. A little heady and high-toned. A blend of 66% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Sauvgnon, and 16% Petite Sirah. 15.8% alcohol. Comes in a bottle that is heavier than it needs to be, weighing 1.56 kg when full. Score: around 8.5. Cost: $65. 2020 Larkmead Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley, CaliforniaMedium to dark garnet in color, this wine smells of cherry, herbs, and cola. In the mouth, cherry cola flavors mix with chopped herbs and a hint of mocha. Fine, powdery tannins caress rather than squeeze the palate, and herbal and mocha notes linger in the finish. 14.5% alcohol.  Score: between 9 and 9.5. Cost: $125."
"On the narrow ""boot"" of Italy, at least the part that protrudes into the Mediterranean, there exists one and only one fully landlocked province. There, in the middle of the boot, sits Umbria, with no coastline to speak of. Named after the ancient Umbri tribes that pre-dated the Roman empire, it doesn't get a lot of tourist traffic despite possessing the same goegeous agrarian landscapes and picturesque medieval towns that draw so many to Tuscany and other, more popular destinations. Sometimes referred to as the green heart of Italy, Umbria is known for olive oil, truffles, beans, lentils, and wild game. It has far more forested and uncultivated lands than many neighboring provinces, and it has historically not received much attention from a wine perspective compared to many places in Italy. Just like everywhere else in this country of wine, Umbria has its own unique set of wines worth exploring, often with interesting stories behind them. Many Italian wines have histories that stretch back hundreds of years. Some are shrouded in mystery. And still others are relatively new narratives that continue to unfold today. The story of the wine we know today as Montefalco Sagrantino (or Sagrantino di Montefalco depending on your pleasure) is some mix of all these. It has a foggy past, a relatively short modern history, and a future of opportunity. Every wine producer you speak with in Umbria will tell you that Sagrantino is an ancient grape that has been growing in the region since time immemorial. We do know that grapes have been grown in Umbria for millennia. Whether those grapes were Sagrantino, however, is much less clear. The first clear references to a wine called Sagrantino (a name thought to be derived from sacre or ""sacred"") date to the late 16th Century. The most reliable written records clearly identifying the grape variety of Sagrantino from Umbria, however, are not found until the late 1800s. What's more, it is clear that up until the point that the Sagrantino grape nearly went extinct (following the Second World War) Montefalco Sagrantino was always sweet, made in the passito style by drying grapes on wooden racks for weeks following harvest. In fact, when the DOCG designation for Montefalco Sagrantino was made in 1977 it was only for sweet wines (the dry version got a DOC designation a couple of years later, and was elevated to DOCG in 1992). ""When the director asked us for samples for the DOCG submission, we had a hard time finding five producers with five vintages each,"" recalls Marco Caprai, son of pioneering producer Arnaldo Caprai, the undisputed godfather of Montefalco Sagrantino. When the DOCG was awarded, there were only 163 acres of Sagrantino vineyards in the region. As recently as 2010 there were less than a dozen producers of Montefalco Sagrantino farming less than 200 acres of vineyards, but the last 15 years have seen a remarkable flowering of producers. Montefalco now includes more than 70 commercial wineries farming almost 1000 acres of Sagrantino. None of them are particularly large in the grand scheme of things, the median production level being around 13,000 cases of wine annually. While a few stalwart producers continue to make the sweet style of Sagrantino, today 95% of Montefalco Sagrantino consists of dry red wine. The nearly 60 new producers of Montefalco Sagrantino that have sprung up in the last 15 years have emerged from the region's existing agricultural society--farmers who decided to take a corner of their existing fields and put in some vines. This phenomenon helps make sense of the somewhat pointillist map of plantings in the Montefalco appellation. As you can see, there is no massive concentration of vineyards in any one particular location. This scattering of vineyards stands in marked contrast to many more famous wine regions such as Brunello di Montalcino or Barolo, where vineyards take up much of the landscape. During my visit to the region, driving through lush farmlands, orchards, and green belts to get from one winery to another, more than one producer pointed out that by putting a vineyard here and a vineyard there, rather than in huge swaths, the region has maintained a great deal of biodiversity, which many credit with their fairly low pest and disease pressure. This patchwork of plantings also makes it a bit hard to make terroir-driven generalizations about the region, though compared to many wine regions, the Montefalco DOC has perhaps less variation in geology than most. Sitting in a fertile bowl surrounded by mountains of various heights that lend the area a more decidedly continental climate, the Montefalco appellation has roughly four types of soil. Each is a variation on calcareous clay, some with a little more sand, some more alluvial thanks to erosion from nearby hills, some with a bit more calcified marine sediments, others with more rocky marls. I have not tasted thoroughly enough in the region to be able to say with any confidence that these differences translate into consistently perceivable sensory characteristics. Few people forget their first taste of a Montefalco Sagrantino, and unfortunately, that's not necessarily a good thing. The experience is often somewhat brutal. Described by author Ian d'Agata as ""Italy's most tannic red wine, by far,"" Sagrantinos can feature punishingly hard tannins that take many years to soften in the bottle. Indeed, tasting newly-released Sagrantino or (heavens forbid) barrel-tasting the most recent vintage of Sagrantino can prove to be a fairly masochistic pastime. Endowed with thick, dark skins packed with anthocyanins, Sagrantino is a beast of a wine, no two ways about it. These polyphenols, combined with reasonably good acid retention, even when ripe, makes for a wine with the potential for significant age-worthiness. Put another way, however, as many of us have experienced, the tannins not only allow the wine to age well, they absolutely demand it. In its youth, Sagrantino is deeply colored and richly flavored with cherry fruit flavors and often floral or dried floral overtones. Picked at what most producers consider ripeness, it makes for an intense, often higher alcohol red, with powerful musculature. The tannins, just as with other intense grapes such as Tannat or Petite Sirah, need to be carefully managed, but the way that most producers in Montefalco do this is somewhat counter-intuitive: extended maceration. While leaving fermenting grape juice or the resulting wine in contact with the grape skins pulls out even more of the tannins from the skins and seeds, it also allows them to chain up and get longer. Known as polymerization, this process makes the sensory impact of those tannins less harsh and grating, more smooth and supple. The tannins of a well-macerated Sagrantino might still hit you like a boulder rolling down a hill, but the boulder will be covered in velvet and it won't be moving quite so fast when it bowls you over. Time in the bottle works wonders, and really I don't recommend drinking Montefalco Sagrantino for at least 5 to 10 years to truly appreciate its charms. For more accessible drinking, there's Montefalco Rosso, which usually contains more Sangiovese than Sagrantino, and makes for a much more accessible glass of Umbrian wine for those with less patience and perhaps lower budgets. On the one hand, the commercial acceptance and prominence achieved by Montefalco Sagrantino in the last 20 years can be described as nothing less than astonishing. Going from a handful of producers making wine that was rarely consumed outside of the province to a substantial association of 70 producers with Tre-Bicchieri-Winning wines and some measure of international recognition represents an almost unthinkable amount of progress in such a short time. On the other hand, we are still clearly at the beginning of Montefalco Sagrantino's story. Farming techniques are evolving, as are winemaking techniques. And they must continue to do so, both for the exigencies of climate chaos as well as for a continued march towards higher quality. The top bottlings of Montefalco Sagrantino can be impressive, and with age, deeply rewarding to drink, but as a whole, there is room for not just improvement, but refinement of the wine. Not everyone can have a shoulder of roasted wild boar over lentils to justify a glass of the dark, brooding wine of falcons. Here are some of my favorite Montefalco Sagrantinos and Rossos from the visit I made as a guest of the Consorzio Tutela Vini Montefalco this past year. UPDATE: Enough people have asked that I now feel compelled to note that I will be covering the (excellent) wines of Paolo Bea in a separate post to be made in the future. 2019 Tabarrini ""White Label Campo alla Cerqua"" Montefalco Sagrantino, Umbria, ItalyMedium garnet in the glass, this wine smells of pure cherry and plum. In the mouth, somewhat crystalline flavors of cherry and plum mix with dusty road tannins that coat the mouth, as flavors of sweet cedar and forest floor emerge on the palate. There's a hint of herbal bitterness in the finish, but the wine leaves the overall impression of clarity and brightness. The tannins are muscular but not brawny. Fantastic. This is a special bottling made with a white label instead of a black label, a change-up that makes its impish maker cackle in delight. It spends more than a month on the skins following fermentation, and then 36 months in large-format oak barrels before bottling. Score: around 9.5. Cost: $?? - It's not clear to me if it is even really for sale. Without a doubt, there's something special about volcanic wines. The fruit that grows on vines plunged into the remains of"
"This week included an interesting mix of wines, from a fancy (and very pricey) Sauvignon Blanc from Chalk Hill in Sonoma to a tasty white from off the beaten path in the Southern Rhone Valley. The latter was a very pretty mix of grapes from Chapoutier that delivers impressive flavor and quality for $17. Not to be outdone, the Paul Jaboulet Aine Condrieu offers Northern Rhone flavors without succumbing to the overt richness that sometimes characterizes Viognier. Closer to home, the Dutton-Goldfield Chardonnay from Walker Hill Vineyard offers a nice expression of the foggy climes of Green Valley. I really enjoy its floral lightness and what seems like a mineral-driven commitment to stay a long ways away from rich butteriness. Adding a little color, I have two roses to recommend this week. One from Rosemary Cakebread's Gallica label in Napa, which unites Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon in a surprisingly crisp combination, the other a more classic Mourvedre and Syrah combination from VITAL in Washington. VITAL is a very interesting wine brand, created to fund social justice and equity programs for vineyard workers in the state, combining worthy cause and deliciousness neatly in one package. I've got a couple of Pinots this week, a unapoligetically rich rendition of the Sonoma Coast from Paul Hobbs, and a leaner interpretation of the grape from the Macedon Ranges in Australia, courtesy of Shadowfax. Last but not least, I've got a juicy Zinfandel from Dutton-Goldfield, a nice Grenache from Gallica, and a Merlot from Sutro Wines in Sonoma's Alexander Valley. Notes on all these below."
"This week included mostly sparkling and white wines entirely by coincidence, as I just grabbed a bunch of samples waiting to be tasted. Starting with the fun and friendly and moving to more serious, I can recommend the La Farra Extra Dry Prosecco Superior, which comes from one of the world's steepest and most impressive single vineyard sites, the Rive di Far di Soligo. For anyone looking for a supremely easy-to-drink Prosecco, this would do the trick (remember that Extra Dry means faintly sweet). On the other end of the spectrum, a 10-year-old aged Cava from the family-run, biodynamically-farmed Pares Balta offers all the secondary and tertiary characteristics of a long-aged sparkling wine: a patina of flavors that will appeal to some but not to all. On the pinker side of California sparkling wine, check out the faintly funky (and wonderfully named) Sunset Debris from Josh Hammerling, or the regal and composed pink version of Domaine Carneros' epic Le Reve. Before we head off into Chardonnay-land, let's tarry for a moment in the quirky-white zone, with a maturing bottle of Grenache Blanc from Two Shepherds winery, a dry botrytized Chenin Blanc from Limited Addition Wines in Oregon, a Viognier from Aridus in Arizona, and a surprisingly crisp Rhone white blend from Chateau Pesquie in Mont Ventoux. Each of these wines offers something well outside the mainstream of white wine that will reward curiosity, and a couple of the wines, especially the Pesquie, are fantastic values. Now let's tell a tale of three Chardonnays. The first, from Open Claim Vineyards in Oregon aspires to luxury and scarcity, and is made with all the expense, talent, and dedication that you would expect, including the heavier-than-it-needs-to-be bottle that some people think is required to convey gravitas and impress the consumer. Their Chardonnay is good, but didn't dramatically outshine the two $18 Chardonnays I tasted alongside it this week--one from Qupe in Santa Barbara and the other from Pellegrini Vineyards in New York's North Fork of Long Island. Lastly, I've got an excellent value Malbec from Terrazas de los Andes in Argentina's Mendoza region. Grown above 3000 feet of elevation, this Reserva bottling offers excellent acidity and brightness along with its intense berry fruit that will satisfy a lot of people's palates. And at under $20, it will be easy on most people's pocketbooks. Notes on all these below. 2021 La Farra ""Extra Dry"" Prosecco, Rive di Farra di Soligo, Conegliano-Valdobbiadene, Veneto, ItalyPale greenish gold in the glass with fine bubbles, this wine smells of freshly cut apples and white flowers. In the mouth, lightly sweet flavors of apples and fior di latte gelato have a nice crisp cleanliness to them. Pretty and bright. 11.5% alcohol. Score: between 8.5 and 9. Cost: $18. 2021 Hamerling Wines ""Sunset Debris"" Sparkling Rose of Pinot Noir, CaliforniaA pale coppery pink in the glass with medium-fine bubbles, this wine smells of citrus peel and redcurrant. In the mouth, there's a faint funk to the wine like a hint of sweaty gym socks, before the bright berry and citrus peel flavors take over with a hint of peach and salty pastry cream. On balance, quite tasty. 11.5% alcohol. Score: between 8.5 and 9. Cost: $58. 2019 Two Shepherds ""A tribute to Saralee - Catie's Corner Vineyard"" Grenache Blanc, Russian River Valley, Sonoma, CaliforniaPale yellow-gold in the glass, this wine smells of beeswax, apples and pears. In the mouth, pear and honeysuckle flavors mix with a hint of buttery shortbread. Excellent acidity and brightness. Native yeast fermented and aged in 60% neutral barrels and 40% stainless steel. 175 cases made. 13.1% alcohol. Score: around 9. Cost: $32. 2020 Aridus Wine Company Viognier, ArizonaPale greenish gold in the glass, this wine smells of orange peel and hints of peach. In the mouth, silky flavors of apricot, lemon curd, and a touch of citrus zest are juicy with decent acidity. There's a faint citrus bitterness in the finish. 13.2% alcohol. Score: around 8.5. Cost: $40. 2019 Open Claim Vineyards Chardonnay, Williamette Valley, OregonPale gold in the glass with a slight greenish tinge, this wine smells of lemon, crushed hazelnuts, and vanilla. In the mouth, lemon pith, vanilla, and pastry cream flavors have an ethereal quality to them that is somewhat arresting, with good acidity and a pithy quality to the finish. Tasty, if a bit polished. 13.5% alcohol. Comes in an unnecessarily heavy bottle, weighing 1.574 kg when full, meaning that the bottle weights more than the wine it contains. Score: between 8.5 and 9. Cost: $75. How exclusive is Ultramarine, the single-vineyard sparkling wine made by winemaker Michael Cruse? Well, the wine was first released in"
"This past week included a few tasty wines from Edio Vineyards in the high-elevation Sierra Foothills of El Dorado County. Edio Vineyards is the brand name for wines produced by Delfino Farms, a family-run outfit where the younger generation have decided to make a go of things rather than sell off or let their family ranch fall into disrepair. To my palate, they're doing an excellent job, making restrained, clean wines with excellent acidity and bright fruit expressions. I liked Robyn's Blend, an unusual combination of Picpoul, Chenin Blanc, and Chardonnay, as well as their Mourvedre and Primitivo, both of which were very light on their feet. I've reviewed the wines from Neely Wines in the Santa Cruz Mountains before, and this week I have their stone-inflected Home Block Chardonnay to recommend to you. Sticking with the white genre for a moment longer, Gerard Bertrand is a somewhat larger-than-life figure, a former French national rugby star who returned to manage his family's wine estate in the Languedoc after the death of his father. Quite admirably, he was an early adopter of organic viticulture and has gone more or less fully biodynamic for his entire production, loudly proclaiming both the environmental virtues as well as wine quality virtues of doing so. All of which makes it that much more ridiculous that his Cigalus Blanc wine is packaged in a dreadfully heavy glass bottle that weighs more than the wine inside it. Reducing bottle weight is one of the single biggest (and I would argue easiest to implement) change a winery can make to its carbon footprint. I find it utterly confounding that a winery focused on the environment and sustainability would continue to package its wines in such heavy glass. But like the expensive French oak used on this blend of Viognier and Chardonnay, I suppose Betrand thinks it conveys luxury. The wine would be better without either. Josh Hammerling made a name for himself as an ""indie"" producer of sparkling wines, but he also produces still wines, some of them quite good, as evidenced by this delicate rose of Merlot, named Summer Hum from San Benito County. It's fresh and juicy and thankfully without some of the bitter weight that Merlot can bring to a rose if not treated gently and picked at the right time. From here we move into Pinot territory, with another tasty rendition of the grape, Petaluma-Gap-style, from Darling Wines, and a perennial favorite bottling of mine from Dutton-Goldfield, their Angel Camp Vineyard in Anderson Valley. Moving a little farther north, I've got two more Pinot Noirs from Project M Wines, a single-vineyard bottling from the Eola-Amity Hills, and a regional blend called ""Shadow,"" both of which are compelling in their own way. Last but not least I can recommend the ""6"" Syrah from biodynamic producer Cowhorn Vineyards, which hails from the Applegate Valley in Southern Oregon. This is an earthy-but-bright interpretation of the grape that will appeal to those who prefer their Syrah a bit leaner. Notes on all these below. Quite a few wines this week were not in the Wine-Searcher database, but some Googling about for the producer web sites should get you what you need if you're looking to buy. 2022 Edio Vineyards ""Robyn's Blend"" White Blend, El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, CaliforniaNear colorless in the glass with just a faint hint of greenish gold, this wine smells of honeysuckle, lemon pith and ripe apples. In the mouth, silky flavors of Asian pear, apple, Meyer lemon pith, and grapefruit have a faint salinity that, combined with the nice acidity makes for a mouthwatering package. A blend of 47% Picpoul, 47% Chenin Blanc, 6% Chardonnay aged for 5 months in 20% new French oak. 12.5% alcohol. 297 cases made Score: between 8.5 and 9. Cost: $34. 2020 Neely ""Spring Ridge Vineyards - Home Block"" Chardonnay, Santa Cruz Mountains, CaliforniaLight to medium yellow-gold in the glass, this wine smells of wet stone, white flowers, and a hint of lemon pith. In the mouth, stony flavors of lemon pith, lemon juice, and white flowers are wonderfully knit together, but could use just a touch more acidity to keep them brisk. 12.4% alcohol. Score: around 8.5. Cost: $50. 2021 Darling Family Wines ""Grand Vent Vineyard"" Pinot Noir, Petaluma Gap, Sonoma, CaliforniaLight garnet in the glass, this wine smells of green herbs and woody stems mixed with berries. In the mouth, bright raspberry and pomegranate flavors mix with potting soil and dried herbs, as fine-grained tannins flex their muscles around the palate. Nice earthy finish with hints of citrus. Excellent acidity. Vineyard is 13 miles from the Pacific, planted on Steinbeck Loam with an elevation of 270 feet. 12.1% alcohol.  Score: around 9. Cost: $60. 2016 Cowhorn ""6"" Syrah, Applegate Valley, Southern OregonDark garnet in the glass, this wine smells of blackberry, carob, and a hint of earth. In the mouth, earthy blackberry and black cherry flavors are wrapped in a muscular fist of fine-grained tannins. Hints of herbs linger in the finish. Excellent acidity. Biodynamically produced. 13.7% alcohol. Score: between 8.5 and 9.. Cost: $45. 2020 Edio Vineyards ""Estate Blend"" Mourvedre, El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, CaliforniaLight to medium garnet in the glass with purple highlights, this wine smells of blueberries and flowers and a hint of marijuana smoke. In the mouth, bright and juicy flavors of blueberry, black cherry, and huckleberry have fantastic acidity and a sour cherry tang that lingers mouthwateringly through the finish. Aged in 33% new oak. 13.8% alcohol. Score: around 9. Cost: $42. 2020 Edio Vineyards Primitivo, El Dorado, Sierra Foothills, CaliforniaLight to medium garnet in the glass, this wine smells of blackberries and blueberries. In the mouth, blackberry and blueberry flavors are bright and aromatic with floral overtones. Excellent, juicy acidity makes the salivary glands gush with delight. Hints of cedar and licorice linger with the bright fruit in the finish. Aged in 25% new oak. 14.3% alcohol. Comes in a bottle that is heavier than it needs to be, weighing 1.51 kg when full.
